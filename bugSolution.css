The issue was likely caused by an improperly formatted or unreachable image URL in the `background-image` property.  The solution involves ensuring the correct URL path is used, and potentially checking for caching or other browser-specific issues.  Adding `background-size: cover;` is also a possible solution to ensure that the background image covers the entire element. Here's the updated code:

```css
.element {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  background-image: url('correct/image/path.jpg'); /* Verify this path! */
  background-size: cover; /* Ensures image covers the element */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
In addition, make sure that the image file (`correct/image/path.jpg`) actually exists at the specified location relative to your CSS file. Clearing your browser's cache can also help.
